## How does it work?

### I7ACHI
#### RC
Itachi_RC works with an XBOX ONE controller that is paired by BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). It uses a [BLUEPAD32](https://github.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32) library. Of all the data, I only use the JOYSTICK data and program the movement speed of the motors.
In theory, you could link any control that is in the [BLUEPAD32](https://github.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32) list.

***It is necessary to install the [BLUEPAD32](https://github.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32) library.***
