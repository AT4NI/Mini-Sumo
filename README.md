# Mini-Sumo
Codes and documentation for my minisumo robot.
It is focused on the development of competition robots made by me.
The repository will include: 3D models, code, PCB and electronic schematics.

**NOTE: The projects developed may have errors that will be corrected in the future.**

*The projects marked in italic are projects that are still on progress*

# Why did I make a repository?
It was made for fans of robotics competition, helping them to get access to information.
I would like any fan to be able to make their own robots and have fun.
Also, I would like to have version control of my projects.

# Folders

## Robots
- I7ACH1: Minisumo with 4 sensors and 2 line sensor
- SIRUKI: Microsumo with 3 sensors and 1 line sensor
- ALO: Microsumo with 2 sensors and 1 line sensor
- ATANI: Amateur RC Minisumo
## PCB's
- Main boards:
  - *SIRUKI: PCB designed for micro-sumo.*

## Code
- I7ach1: main code used for minisumo robot I7ach1 which uses a ESP32-C3 as the main board
- *SIRUKI: main code used for microsumo robot SIRUKI which uses a ESP32-C3 as the main controller*
- ALO: main code used for microsumo robot ALO which uses a ESP32-C3 as the main controller
- ATANI: main code used for minisumo robot ATANI which uses a ARDUINO NANO as the main controller
## 3D Data
- Robots
	- I7ach1: Base of the robot is steel and the case is PLA.
	- *SIRUKI: Base of the robot is brass and the case is made of PLA*
	- *ALO: The robot is made of PLA*
	- ATANI: The robot is made of PLA.

# Software that I use
The software I use, most of them are free license and easy to use.
The formats of the files are the most friendly with the other types of software used.

- 3D data: I mainly use SOLIDWORKS and FUSION 360 but I upload the files in .IGES and .STL so you can use any 3D CAD software and slicer software out there to modify and/or print the parts.
- PCB's: I upload the gerbers in zip format for easy fabrication **[KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/)** which is a free and open source EDA.
- Code: I use ARDUINO IDE **[ARDUINO IDE ](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide)**
